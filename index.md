## Program description

learnDBM is a Java implementation of a Dynamic Bayesian Multinet (DBM) structure learning algorithm. Moreover, by using the DBM model this implementation has the capability of performing clustering on the data.

## Current release

This is the first implementation of this program. It comes packaged as an executable JAR file, already including the required external libraries.


## Usage

By executing the jar file ...

```shell
$ java -jar learnDBM.jar 
```
... the available command-line options are shown:

```
usage: learnDBM
 -bcDBN,--bcDBN               Learns a bcDBN structure.
 -c,--compact                 Outputs network in compact format, omitting
                              intra-slice edges. Only works if specified
                              together with -d and with --markovLag 1.
 -cDBN,--cDBN                 Learns a cDBN structure.
 -d,--dotFormat               Outputs network in dot format, allowing
                              direct redirection into Graphviz to
                              visualize the graph.
 -i,--file <file>             Input CSV file to be used for network
                              learning.
 -ind,--intra_in <int>        In-degree of the intra-slice network
 -k,--numClusters <int>       Number of cluster in data.
 -m,--markovLag <int>         Maximum Markov lag to be considered, which
                              is the longest distance between connected
                              time-slices. Default is 1, allowing edges
                              from one preceding slice.
 -mt,--MultiThread            Learns the DBN using parallel computations.
 -ns,--nonStationary          Learns a non-stationary network (one
                              transition network per time transition). By
                              default, a stationary DBN is learnt.
 -o,--outputFile <file>       Writes output to <file>. If not supplied,
                              output is written to terminal.
 -p,--numParents <int>        Maximum number of parents from preceding
                              time-slice(s). The default values is 1.
 -pm,--parameters             Learns and outputs the network parameters.
 -sp,--spanning               Forces intra-slice connectivity to be a tree
                              instead of a forest, eventually producing a
                              structure with a lower score.
```


## Input file format

The input file should be in comma-separated values (CSV) format.

*   The first line is the header, naming the attributes and specifying the time slice index, separared by two underscores: "attributeName__t"
*   The order of the attributes must be maintained: "X1__1", "X2__1", "X1__2", "X2__2".
*   The first column contains an identification (string or number) of each subject (this identifier does not affect the learnt network).
*   All other lines correspond to observations of an individual over time.
*   Missing values can be marked as "?" but should not occur, as the algorithm discards the observation (time slice) in question.
*   The variables can have numerical and categorical values.

A very simplistic input file example is the following:

```
"subject_id","X1__0","X2__0","X3__0","X1__1","X2__1","X3__1","X1__2","X2__2","X3__2"
"6","7.0","40.0","5.0","7.0","20.0","5.0","4.0","20.0","5.0"
"7","4.0","40.0","5.0","7.0","40.0","5.0","7.0","40.0","5.0"
"8","7.0","20.0","5.0","7.0","40.0","5.0","4.0","20.0","9.0"
"9","7.0","40.0","9.0","7.0","20.0","5.0","7.0","40.0","?"
"10","7.0","20.0","5.0","4.0","20.0","9.0","7.0","20.0","9.0"
"11","?","20.0","5.0","?","20.0","5.0","4.0","20.0","9.0"
"12","4.0","20.0","5.0","7.0","20.0","5.0","4.0","20.0","9.0"
```
## Example

This example consideres a synthetic dataset generated by 2 DBNs with 5 attributes and 10 time steps.

![](./exmp2_0.png "DBN 1")  ![](./exmp2_1.png "DBN 2")

Each of the above networks was sample to produce the following file:
*   [combinedDataset.csv](./combinedDataset.csv), with 500 observations with 10 time steps from each DBN

The command to learn the networks and compute the clusters is:
```shell
java -jar learnDBM.jar -i ./combinedDataset -k 2 -o /output.csv -mt -d 
```

Which outputs:
```
Starting with stochastic EM.
Number of clusters : 2
Number of Observations : 2000

--- Cluster 0 ---
X2[0] -> X1[1]
X2[0] -> X2[1]
X4[0] -> X3[1]
X3[0] -> X4[1]
X5[0] -> X5[1]

X5[1] -> X2[1]
X5[1] -> X3[1]
X1[1] -> X4[1]
X4[1] -> X5[1]


Alpha: 0.5
--- Cluster 1 ---
X2[0] -> X1[1]
X2[0] -> X2[1]
X5[0] -> X3[1]
X2[0] -> X4[1]
X3[0] -> X5[1]

X2[1] -> X1[1]
X4[1] -> X2[1]
X4[1] -> X3[1]
X2[1] -> X5[1]


Alpha: 0.5

BIC Score: -96415.86555001826
```

The flag -d produces the following:

![](./exmp2_net[0].png "Output DBN 1")  ![](./exmp2_net[1].png "Output DBN 2")


The clustering output has the following Cluster Validity Indexes (CVIs):

| CVI   | Score       |
|:------|:------------|
| ARI   | 0.99800000  |
| RI    | 0.9990000   |
| J     | 0.9980010   |
| FM    | 0.9989995   |
| VI    | 0.003434294 |
